# Password_Generator

- The application utilizes Java's built-in randomization functions to generate passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring strong security.

- In this project, I have developed a Java application that serves as a random password generator. The main objective is to create a user-friendly interface using NetBeans, JFrame, and Swing components to generate secure and unique passwords.
